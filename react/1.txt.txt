When fetching data in a Server Component, prefer async and await over use. async and await pick up rendering from the point where await was invoked, whereas use re-renders the component after the data is resolved.

Prefer creating Promises in Server Components and passing them to Client Components over creating Promises in Client Components. Promises created in Client Components are recreated on every render. Promises passed from a Server Component to a Client Component are stable across re-renders.

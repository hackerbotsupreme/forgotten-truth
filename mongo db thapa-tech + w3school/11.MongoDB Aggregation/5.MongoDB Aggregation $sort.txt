MongoDB Aggregation $sort

Aggregation $sort
This aggregation stage groups 
sorts all documents in the 
specified sort order.

Remember that the order of 
your stages matters. Each 
stage only acts upon the 
documents that previous 
stages provide.

Example
In this example, we are 
using the "sample_airbnb" 
database loaded from our 
sample data in the Intro 
to Aggregations section.

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([ 
  { 
    $sort: { "accommodates": -1 } 
  },
  {
    $project: {
      "name": 1,
      "accommodates": 1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
])

This will return the 
documents sorted in 
descending order by 
the accommodates field.

The sort order can be 
chosen by using 1 or -1. 
1 is ascending and -1 
is descending.

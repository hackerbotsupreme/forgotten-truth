MongoDB Aggregation $match

Aggregation $match
This aggregation stage behaves 
like a find. It will filter 
documents that match the query 
provided.

Using $match early in the 
pipeline can improve performance 
since it limits the number of 
documents the next stages 
must process.

Example
In this example, we are using 
the "sample_airbnb" database 
loaded from our sample data 
in the Intro to Aggregations 
section.

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([ 
  { $match : { property_type : "House" } },
  { $limit: 2 },
  { $project: {
    "name": 1,
    "bedrooms": 1,
    "price": 1
  }}
])

This will only return 
documents that have the 
property_type of "House".

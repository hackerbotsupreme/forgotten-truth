MongoDB Aggregation $limit

Aggregation $limit
This aggregation stage limits 
the number of documents passed 
to the next stage.

Example
In this example, we are using 
the "sample_mflix" database 
loaded from our sample data in 
the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.movies.aggregate([ { $limit: 1 } ])

This will return the 1 movie 
from the collection.

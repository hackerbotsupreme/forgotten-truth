MongoDB Aggregation $group

Aggregation $group
This aggregation stage groups 
documents by the unique _id 
expression provided.

Don't confuse this _id expression 
with the _id ObjectId provided 
to each document.

Example
In this example, we are using 
the "sample_airbnb" database 
loaded from our sample data in 
the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate(
    [ { $group : { _id : "$property_type" } } ]
)

This will return the distinct 
values from the property_type field.

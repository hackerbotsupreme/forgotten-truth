MongoDB Aggregation $out

Aggregation $out
This aggregation stage writes 
the returned documents from the 
aggregation pipeline to a 
collection.

The $out stage must be 
the last stage of the 
aggregation pipeline.

Example
In this example, we are 
using the "sample_airbnb" 
database loaded from our 
sample data in the Intro 
to Aggregations section.

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$property_type",
      properties: {
        $push: {
          name: "$name",
          accommodates: "$accommodates",
          price: "$price",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  { $out: "properties_by_type" },
])

The first stage will group 
properties by the property_type 
and include the name, 
accommodates, and price 
fields for each. The $out 
stage will create a new 
collection called 
properties_by_type in 
the current database and 
write the resulting 
documents into that collection.

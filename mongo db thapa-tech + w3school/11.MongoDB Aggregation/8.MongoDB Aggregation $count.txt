MongoDB Aggregation $count

Aggregation $count
This aggregation stage 
counts the total amount 
of documents passed from 
the previous stage.

Example
In this example, we are 
using the "sample_restaurants" 
database loaded from our sample 
data in the Intro to 
Aggregations section.

db.restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { "cuisine": "Chinese" }
  },
  {
    $count: "totalChinese"
  }
])

This will return the number 
of documents at the $count 
stage as a field called 
"totalChinese".

MongoDB Aggregation $lookup

Aggregation $lookup
This aggregation stage performs 
a left outer join to a collection 
in the same database.

There are four required fields:

from: The collection to use for 
lookup in the same database

localField: The field in 
the primary collection that 
can be used as a unique 
identifier in the from collection.

foreignField: The field in the 
from collection that can be 
used as a unique identifier 
in the primary collection.

as: The name of the new 
field that will contain 
the matching documents 
from the from collection.

Example
In this example, we are 
using the "sample_mflix" 
database loaded from our 
sample data in the Intro 
to Aggregations section.

db.comments.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "movies",
      localField: "movie_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "movie_details",
    },
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
])

This will return the 
movie data along with 
each comment.

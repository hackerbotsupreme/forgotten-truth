// MongoDB mongosh Find
// Find Data
// There are 2 methods to find 
// and select data from a MongoDB 
// collection, find() and findOne().

// to find 
// and select data from a collection 
// in MongoDB, we can use the find() 
// method.
find()

// This method accepts a query 
// object. If left empty, all 
// documents will be returned.
db.posts.find()

// Example
// To select only one document, 
// we can use the findOne() method.
findOne()

// This method accepts a query object. 
// If left empty, it will return 
// the first document it finds.

// Note: This method only returns 
// the first match it finds.

Example
db.posts.findOne()
Querying Data
To query, or filter, data we 
can include a query in our 
find() or findOne() methods.

Example
db.posts.find( {category: "News"} )
// Projection
// Both find methods accept a 
// second parameter called projection.

// This parameter is an object that 
// describes which fields to include 
// in the results.

// Note: This parameter is optional. 
// If omitted, all fields will be 
// included in the results.

Example
This example will only display 
the title and date fields in 
the results.

db.posts.find({}, {title: 1, date: 1})
Notice that the _id field is 
also included. This field is 
always included unless 
specifically excluded.

We use a 1 to include a field 
and 0 to exclude a field.

Example
This time, let's exclude the _id field.

db.posts.find({}, {_id: 0, title: 1, date: 1})

Note: You cannot use both 0 and 1 in 
the same object. The only exception 
is the _id field. You should either 
specify the fields you would like 
to include or the fields you would 
like to exclude.

Let's exclude the date category field. 
All other fields will be included 
in the results.

Example
db.posts.find({}, {category: 0})

We will get an error if we try to 
specify both 0 and 1 in the same object.

Example
db.posts.find({}, {title: 1, date: 0})
